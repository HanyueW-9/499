 link to the source code of NNOneSplit function:https://github.com/HanyueW-9/499/blob/master/project3.R
 how to run it on the data sets? 
 1. we input the data set with 'data <- read.table(url("https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/datasets/spam.data"))'
 then we defined the argument of the function

Data set download from :  https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/data.html
you can 

"from six.moves import urllib"
"SOURCE_URL = #data file path from internet "
to install the data set
